David Macaulay        Born on December 2, 1946, David Macaulay was ten when his family moved from England to the United States. An early fascination with simple technology and a love of model making and drawing ultimately led him to study architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design. He received his degree in 1969 after spending his fifth year with RISD’s European Honors Program in Rome. The next four years were spent working in interior design, teaching junior and senior high school art and tinkering with the idea of making books.

Alvin O. Converse        Al Converse served on Thayer School's regular faculty from 1963 to 2000. Before that he taught chemical engineering at Carnegie Institute of Technology and the Queensland University, Brisbane, Australia. Then Converse found himself attracted to the broad nature of Thayer's engineering sciences program: "I liked Thayer School's engineering sciences approach and its stress on creative engineering design."

Charles E. Hutchinson        "I don't ever intend to 'retire' retire. I've tried it four times—once from U. Mass, twice from Thayer School, and then from GlycoFi in 2006," said Charles Hutchinson ("Hutch," as he is known to the Dartmouth community). After 19 years with the electrical and computer engineering department of the University of Massachusetts, Hutch came to Dartmouth in 1984 at the encouragement of John Strohbehn, a Thayer School professor and classmate of Hutch's at Stanford. "He knew I had not been happy with the confining format of specialization in engineering education. He kept talking about the opportunity to expand Thayer School's interdisciplinary approach." It was a convincing argument, and Hutch came to Thayer School to stay.

He has also taught and/or did research at the University of Aachen (Germany), at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, and at the Helmut Schmidt University (Hamburg). He was Thayer School's first director of undergraduate studies and later served for three years as the Chair of the Engineering Sciences Department. At Thayer School he has taught thermodynamics, systems, fluid mechanics, two-phase flow, heat and mass transfer, and a course on the technology of sailing.
Bengt Ulf Osten Sonnerup        Bengt Sonnerup joined Thayer School in 1964 and remained on the regular faculty until 2000. "I fell in love with the look and feel of the Dartmouth campus," said Sonnerup. "... And, of course, the opportunity to join [Millett Morgan's radiophysics lab] doing cutting edge research in space physics was very appealing."
Graham B. Wallis        Graham Wallis served as a member of the Thayer School faculty from 1962 to 2001. He was selected by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) to receive the 1994 Fluids Engineering Award "for extensive research in the field of two-phase flow, and for writing on the extension of potential flow theory to two-phase flows."
